This research introduce **HIRM** (Hedging with IRM), a research framework for robust hedging, designed to test whether Invariant Risk Minimization improves tail-risk performance compared to standard deep hedging approaches.

**Research question:** Does adding Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) to a deep hedging framework improve robustness against regime shifts (such as crisis periods like Volmageddon), compared to a standard deep hedger without IRM or trained on alternative regularizations?

## Quick start

## Phase 1 results

A frozen snapshot of the Phase 1 hedging runs is available under [`outputs/_phase1_snapshot/`](outputs/_phase1_snapshot/). The crisis metrics below mirror `outputs/_phase1_snapshot/final_metrics.json` and can be regenerated with:

```bash
make reproduce PHASE=phase1
```

| Model    | Crisis CVaR-95 | Mean PnL | Turnover |
|----------|----------------|----------|----------|
| ERM-v1   | â€“12.4%         | 0.021    | 1.00Ã—    |
| IRM-head | â€“10.7%         | 0.020    | 1.12Ã—    |
| V-REx    | â€“11.0%         | 0.019    | 1.05Ã—    |


1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
2. **Run a training job** (defaults to the ERM baseline)
   ```bash
   make train
   ```
   Override the Hydra config by passing `CONFIG=train/irm` or other configs to the make target.
3. **Evaluate a checkpoint** on the crisis out-of-distribution regime
   ```bash
   make evaluate CHECKPOINT=/path/to/checkpoint.pt
   ```
4. **Full reproduction** of the Phase 1 protocol (ERM, ERM-reg, IRM, GroupDRO, V-REx)
   ```bash
   scripts/make_reproduce.sh
   ```
   Each run mirrors metrics locally under `runs/<timestamp>/` and, if W&B is available, logs to the `invariant-hedging` project.

## Roadmap

### âœ… Phase 1 â€” ERM Baseline (Complete)
See [`experiments/phase1_summary.md`](experiments/phase1_summary.md) for the ERM-v1 baseline protocol and artifacts.

<a id="phase-2-headirm"></a>
### ðŸ“ˆ Phase 2 â€” Head-Only IRM + Diagnostics (Current)
See [`experiments/phase2_plan.md`](experiments/phase2_plan.md) for objectives, sweeps, and metrics.

## Logging and outputs

Every run (train or eval) writes to `runs/<timestamp>/` with the following structure:

- `config.yaml`: resolved Hydra configuration
- `metrics.jsonl`: stepwise metrics
- `final_metrics.json`: summary metrics
- `checkpoints/`: top-k checkpoints selected by validation CVaR-95
- `artifacts/`: crisis tables, QQ plots and any additional evaluation artefacts
- `metadata.json`: git commit hash, platform fingerprint, Python and PyTorch versions

If W&B credentials are available the same metrics are mirrored to the `invariant-hedging` project; offline mode is supported via `WANDB_MODE=offline`.

## Testing

Unit tests cover pricing Greeks, CVaR estimation, cost kernels and deterministic seeding. Run them with:

```bash
make tests
```

## Smoke test

The helper scripts export conservative Intel OpenMP settings so PyTorch runs even in sandboxes with no shared-memory segment. Kick off the short training loop with:

```bash
scripts/run_train.sh train/smoke
```

If you prefer to invoke Python directly, mirror those defaults explicitly:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_THREADING_LAYER=SEQUENTIAL KMP_AFFINITY=disabled KMP_INIT_AT_FORK=FALSE python3 -m src.train --config-name=train/smoke
```

GitHub Actions executes the test suite together with a smoke train/eval pass on every push.

## Data

The synthetic generator supports GBM and Heston dynamics with environment-specific transaction costs. A tiny SPY options slice (`data/spy_sample.csv`) is bundled as a deterministic real-data anchor that exercises the full feature pipeline.

Episode configuration, cost files and model settings live under `configs/`. Adjust these as needed for experiments or sweeps. The default training protocol performs 20k ERM pre-training steps, a 10k IRM ramp, and continues until 150k total updates with environment-balanced batching.

## Reproducibility

`scripts/make_reproduce.sh` re-runs the ERM, ERM-reg, IRM, GroupDRO and V-REx configurations for seed 0, evaluates the best checkpoint for each on the crisis environment, and regenerates the crisis CVaR-95 table plus QQ plots. All seeds are controlled via `configs/train/*.yaml` and `src/utils/seed.py` to guarantee deterministic `metrics.jsonl` for `seed=0`.

## Reproducibility checklist

- Deterministic seeds for training, evaluation, and tests (`seed_list.txt` and Hydra configs).
- Resolved Hydra configs saved under each run directory (`runs/<timestamp>/config.yaml`).
- Metrics logged per-step (`metrics.jsonl`) and in aggregate (`final_metrics.json`) including CVaR-95, Sharpe, and turnover.
- Run metadata captured in `metadata.json` with git commit, platform, Python, and PyTorch versions.
