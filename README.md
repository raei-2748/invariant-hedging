This research introduce **HIRM** (Hedging with IRM), a research framework for robust hedging, designed to test whether Invariant Risk Minimization improves tail-risk performance compared to standard deep hedging approaches.

**Research question:** Does adding Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) to a deep hedging framework improve robustness against regime shifts (such as crisis periods like Volmageddon), compared to a standard deep hedger without IRM or trained on alternative regularizations?

## Quick start

## Phase 1 results

A frozen snapshot of the Phase 1 hedging runs is available under [`outputs/_phase1_snapshot/`](outputs/_phase1_snapshot/). The crisis metrics below mirror `outputs/_phase1_snapshot/final_metrics.json` and can be regenerated with:

```bash
make reproduce PHASE=phase1
```

| Model    | Crisis CVaR-95 | Mean PnL | Turnover |
|----------|----------------|----------|----------|
| ERM-v1   | â€“12.4%         | 0.021    | 1.00Ã—    |
| IRM-head | â€“10.7%         | 0.020    | 1.12Ã—    |
| V-REx    | â€“11.0%         | 0.019    | 1.05Ã—    |


### ðŸ“ˆ Phase 2 â€” Head-Only IRM + Diagnostics (Current)

Phase 2 expands the baseline to test **head-only IRM**, **V-REx**, and early diagnostics (**IG**, **WG**, **MSI**) under jump + liquidity stresses.  See the full plan in [`experiments/phase2_plan.md`](experiments/phase2_plan.md).

**Quick Start**

```bash
# IRM-head sweep (Î» in {1e-2, 1e-1, 1})
python scripts/train.py config=train/phase2 irm.enabled=true irm.mode=head_only irm.lambda=0.1

# V-REx sweep (Î² in {1, 5, 10})
python scripts/train.py config=train/phase2 vrex.enabled=true vrex.beta=10.0
```

Results are saved in `outputs/_phase2_snapshot/`.


1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
2. **Run a training job** (defaults to the ERM baseline)
   ```bash
   make train
   ```
   Override the Hydra config by passing `CONFIG=train/irm` or other configs to the make target.
3. **Evaluate a checkpoint** on the crisis out-of-distribution regime
   ```bash
   make evaluate CHECKPOINT=/path/to/checkpoint.pt
   ```
4. **Full reproduction** of the Phase 1 protocol (ERM, ERM-reg, IRM, GroupDRO, V-REx)
   ```bash
   scripts/make_reproduce.sh
   ```
   Each run mirrors metrics locally under `runs/<timestamp>/` and, if W&B is available, logs to the `invariant-hedging` project.

## Logging and outputs

Every run (train or eval) writes to `runs/<timestamp>/` with the following structure:

- `config.yaml`: resolved Hydra configuration
- `metrics.jsonl`: stepwise metrics
- `final_metrics.json`: summary metrics
- `checkpoints/`: top-k checkpoints selected by validation CVaR-95
- `artifacts/`: crisis tables, QQ plots and any additional evaluation artefacts
- `metadata.json`: git commit hash, platform fingerprint, Python and PyTorch versions

If W&B credentials are available the same metrics are mirrored to the `invariant-hedging` project; offline mode is supported via `WANDB_MODE=offline`.

### Reports

Aggregate tables and publication-ready figures can be regenerated locally with:

```bash
make report
```

This command scans the latest per-seed CSV exports, renders the Phase-2 diagnostics (penalty sweeps, ablations, ISI decomposition, cross-regime heatmaps, and existing scorecard charts), and writes all artefacts to [`outputs/report_assets/`](outputs/report_assets/). The legacy `make phase2_scorecard` entry point now forwards to `make report` for backward compatibility.

## Testing

Unit tests cover pricing Greeks, CVaR estimation, cost kernels and deterministic seeding. Run them with:

```bash
make tests
```

## Diagnostics (PR-04): Invarianceâ€“Robustnessâ€“Efficiency

The diagnostics stack exports per-seed scorecards that align with the paperâ€™s
Iâ€“Râ€“E geometry. After evaluation each enabled run writes a tidy CSV and a JSON
manifest under `runs/<timestamp>/` (or a custom directory configured via
`diagnostics.outputs.dir`). CSV rows contain one entry per environment plus an
`__overall__` aggregate with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `seed, git_hash, exp_id` | Run provenance and experiment identifiers. |
| `split_name, regime_tag, env_id, is_eval_split` | Split metadata and environment labels. |
| `n_obs` | Number of observations used for the diagnostic probe. |
| `C1_global_stability` | Normalised risk dispersion across environments (1 = stable). |
| `C2_mechanistic_stability` | Cosine-alignment of head gradients across environments. |
| `C3_structural_stability` | Representation similarity across environments. |
| `ISI` | Weighted combination of C1/C2/C3 clipped to `[0, 1]`. |
| `IG` | Invariance gap (dispersion of realised outcomes). |
| `WG_risk`, `VR_risk` | Worst-group risk and variance across environments. |
| `ER_mean_pnl`, `TR_turnover` | Efficiency metrics: mean PnL and turnover. |

The manifest (`diagnostics_manifest.json`) records the seed, git hash,
config hash, instrument, metric basis, ISI weights, units, and creation
timestamp for reproducibility.

### Running the diagnostics probe

1. Enable diagnostics in the Hydra config (see `configs/diagnostics/default.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   defaults:
     - diagnostics: default
   ```

2. Provide diagnostic batches (held-out from training) via
   `diagnostics.probe`. Batches are dictionaries containing `risk`, `outcome`,
   `positions`, and optionally `grad`/`representation` tensors per environment.

3. Run evaluation. The export helper will assemble Iâ€“Râ€“E metrics using the new
   modules in `src/diagnostics/` and log the output CSV path via the existing
   run logger.

## Smoke test

The helper scripts export conservative Intel OpenMP settings so PyTorch runs even in sandboxes with no shared-memory segment. Kick off the short training loop with:

```bash
scripts/run_train.sh train/smoke
```

If you prefer to invoke Python directly, mirror those defaults explicitly:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_THREADING_LAYER=SEQUENTIAL KMP_AFFINITY=disabled KMP_INIT_AT_FORK=FALSE python3 -m src.train --config-name=train/smoke
```

GitHub Actions executes the test suite together with a smoke train/eval pass on every push.

## Data

The synthetic generator supports GBM and Heston dynamics with environment-specific transaction costs. A tiny SPY options slice (`data/spy_sample.csv`) is bundled as a deterministic real-data anchor that exercises the full feature pipeline.

Episode configuration, cost files and model settings live under `configs/`. Adjust these as needed for experiments or sweeps. The default training protocol performs 20k ERM pre-training steps, a 10k IRM ramp, and continues until 150k total updates with environment-balanced batching.

## Reproducibility

`scripts/make_reproduce.sh` re-runs the ERM, ERM-reg, IRM, GroupDRO and V-REx configurations for seed 0, evaluates the best checkpoint for each on the crisis environment, and regenerates the crisis CVaR-95 table plus QQ plots. All seeds are controlled via `configs/train/*.yaml` and `src/utils/seed.py` to guarantee deterministic `metrics.jsonl` for `seed=0`.

## Reproducibility checklist

- Deterministic seeds for training, evaluation, and tests (`seed_list.txt` and Hydra configs).
- Resolved Hydra configs saved under each run directory (`runs/<timestamp>/config.yaml`).
- Metrics logged per-step (`metrics.jsonl`) and in aggregate (`final_metrics.json`) including CVaR-95, Sharpe, and turnover.
- Run metadata captured in `metadata.json` with git commit, platform, Python, and PyTorch versions.
